# Global-Superstore-Data-Dashboard

### Introduction
In this project I will describe the analysis process I conducted using a Global Superstore’s dataset. The software I used is Power BI. 
1.Power BI dashboards can be a helpfull tool to provide insights into sales performance and trends of an organization.
2.The dashboard should include key metrics such as total sales, sales by product, sales by location, sales by customer segment, and sales by product category.
3.It should also provide comparisons of performance to prior years, and allow for drill-down into individual market and products.

### Cleaning and Exploring Data
Data Cleaning and Data Modelling
The dataset had been loaded, which was then loaded into PowerBI through the ‘Get Data’ function.
Exploring the data reveals that there are three tables, between which a relational model can be efficiently established.

After removing unwanted columns are rows from the table the above relationship has been created.
In this dataset there is a facts table - Orders and two dimension table- People and Returns.If the "Returns" table contains descriptive information like "Order ID," "Market," and potentially other attributes that provide context or additional details about returns, it could be considered a dimension table.
